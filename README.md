# Freedom from Smoking — by Marie Stone

This is a GitHub-ready project for the landing page **Freedom from Smoking – Quit Smoking for Good in 9 Weeks**.
Designed for quick deployment to Vercel (no coding required).

## What this contains
- Vite + React starter (src folder)
- Tailwind-ready CSS configuration
- Title card and placeholder images in /public
- Simple About section and contact mailto link (theartofrespect@gmail.com)

## How to preview locally (optional)
1. Install Node.js (v18+)
2. Run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. Open http://localhost:5173

## How to publish on GitHub and Vercel (no-code steps)
1. Create a repository on GitHub named **Freedom-from-Smoking-by-Marie-Stone**.
2. Upload the contents of this folder to your new repo (use the green 'Add file' → 'Upload files' button or drag-and-drop).
3. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in with GitHub (or Google), then click **New Project** → **Import Git Repository** and select your repo.
4. Vercel will detect the project (Vite). Click **Deploy**. Your site will be live in under a minute at `https://freedom-from-smoking-by-marie-stone.vercel.app`.
5. To update text or images later, edit the files in GitHub (e.g., src/LandingPage.jsx or files in /public) and push changes — Vercel redeploys automatically.

If you'd like, I can now walk you step-by-step while you upload the files to GitHub and deploy to Vercel. I'm ready when you are.
